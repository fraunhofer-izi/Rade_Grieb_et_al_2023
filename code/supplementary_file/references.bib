              patients pre- and post-B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-specific
              CAR T therapy. Lower diversity of pretherapy T-cell receptor
              (TCR) repertoire, presence of hyperexpanded clones with
              exhaustion phenotype, and BAFF+PD-L1+ myeloid cells in the marrow
              correlated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) following

              increased proportion of CLEC9A+ dendritic cells (DC), CD27+TCF1+
              T cells with diverse T-cell receptors, and emergence of T cells

  abstract = "SUMMARY: A common bioinformatics task in single-cell data
              analysis is to purify a cell type or cell population of interest
              from heterogeneous datasets. Here, we present scGate, an
              algorithm that automatizes marker-based purification of specific
              cell populations, without requiring training data or reference
              gene expression profiles. scGate purifies a cell population of
              interest using a set of markers organized in a hierarchical
              structure, akin to gating strategies employed in flow cytometry.
              scGate outperforms state-of-the-art single-cell classifiers and
              it can be applied to multiple modalities of single-cell data
              (e.g. RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, CITE-seq). scGate is implemented as an R
              package and integrated with the Seurat framework, providing an
              intuitive tool to isolate cell populations of interest from
              heterogeneous single-cell datasets. AVAILABILITY AND
              IMPLEMENTATION: scGate is available as an R package at
              https://github.com/carmonalab/scGate
              (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6202614). Several reproducible
              workflows describing the main functions and usage of the package
              on different single-cell modalities, as well as the code to
              reproduce the benchmark, can be found at
